## Docs vs source code

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è You are looking at the OpenVSCode Server `docs` branch. To see the source code, please [switch to the `main`](https://github.com/gitpod-io/openvscode-server) branch.

### Why a separate branch?

OpenVSCode Server's source in the `main` branch automatically stays up-to-date with the upstream `microsoft/vscode` repository. With the documentation in its own branch, we scope the `diff` between `gitpod-io/openvscode-server` and `microsoft/vscode` to only relevant code changes.

## Deployment guides

Please refer to [Guides](./guides/) to learn how to deploy OpenVSCode Server to your cloud provider of choice.
